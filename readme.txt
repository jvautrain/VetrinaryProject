--NOTES--

Address class has .cpp file just in case. Discuss whether we want it to have any behavior. Possibly re-implement as struct where needed or in Clinic file?

Assistant compensation: What are valid range?
Assistant promptAndStoreAssistantInfo: Discuss use, possibly cut and make robust constructor family instead?

promptAndStore - in general, seems to be just "populate object", perhaps reform?

//Customer-setCustomerInfo() pruned

//Address class, accessers/mutators. 
//if not, how to test boolean repeatedly for "getAddress" methods?
